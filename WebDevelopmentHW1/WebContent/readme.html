	<p> I felt that some of the groups that the links were in for the original CS <br>
		department website were poorly organized. An example of this would be the <br>
		resources tab. This tab was basically used as a misc section and items that<br>
		they didn't feel belonged under the more specific drop downs, belonged there <br>
		I also felt that the separation of the advising tag and the academic programs tab<br>
		was unnecessary and that those sections can be easily combined.</p>
	<p>What I did to change the way the  is combine the advising and academic programs page<br>
		into one advising page. This made it into one page because all items that had to do<br>
		with advising is in one section. In the advising page, I also created another hierarchy <br>
		that divided the advising forms, majors, and the CS course information. For the next tab,<br>
		I combined the People and Contact tab from the original site and put them under a link<br>
		called faculty. For the last item in the list, I just kept resources very similar but<br>
		called it organizations and careers and left it that way.</p>
